# ðŸ”§ Blank Screen Fix - Railway Deployment

## Problem
Your app deployed to Railway but showed a blank screen.

## Root Cause
The server was serving static files from the wrong directory. It was looking in the root folder instead of the `dist/` folder where the built React app lives.

## Solution Applied âœ…

### Changed in `server.js`:

**Before:**
```javascript
app.use(express.static(__dirname)); // Wrong - serves from root
```

**After:**
```javascript
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "dist"))); // Correct - serves from dist/
```

### Added SPA Fallback Route:
```javascript
// Fallback route for React Router (SPA)
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "dist", "index.html"));
});
```

This ensures all routes go to `index.html` so React Router can handle them.

## What Happens Now

1. **Build Phase:** `npm run build` creates `/dist` folder with compiled React app
2. **Start Phase:** `node server.js` starts Express server
3. **Serve Phase:** Express serves `/dist/index.html` as the main page
4. **Routing:** React Router handles all client-side navigation
5. **APIs:** `/api/*` endpoints work as before

## Redeploy on Railway

Railway will **automatically redeploy** when it detects the GitHub push.

**Check status:**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Look for "Deployment in progress" or "Deployment successful"
4. Wait 2-5 minutes

## Test After Redeploy

Once Railway finishes deploying:

```bash
# Test the homepage
curl https://candlpage-production.up.railway.app/

# Should return HTML (not blank)
# Should see <html>, <head>, <body> tags

# Test an API
curl -X POST https://candlpage-production.up.railway.app/api/keywords \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic":"test"}'
```

## Expected Result

âœ… Homepage loads with all 4 tool cards  
âœ… Navigation works  
âœ… APIs respond correctly  
âœ… No blank screen

**The fix is deployed! Railway will redeploy automatically. Check back in 5 minutes.** ðŸš€
